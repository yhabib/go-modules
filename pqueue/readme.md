# Priority Queue

A simple implementation in GO of a Priority Queue with Binary Heaps:
* Insert(k) adds a new item to the heap.
* FindMin() returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving item in the heap.
* DelMin() returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the item from the heap.
* IsEmpty() returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.
* Size() returns the number of items in the heap.
* BuildHeap(list) builds a new heap from a list of keys.
